## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Start the application

Don't forget to setup the following .env in each app
Run `npx nx dev host` to start the development server, it will be the HOST app.
Run `npx nx dev actions` to start the development server, it will be the REMOTE app that is responsable of button actions.
Run `npx nx dev list` to start the development server, it will be the REMOTE app that is responsable of show the pokemons list.

Also it could be up with `npx nx run-many --target=dev`

## Build for production

Run `npx nx run-many --target=build` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```
